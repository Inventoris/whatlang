What language is missing: [name of the language]

### How to Add a Language

1. Open **Google Maps**: https://www.google.com/maps/  
2. Navigate to a country where the missing language is commonly used.  
3. Switch to **Street View** mode.  
4. Explore the streets and find any examples of written text: shop signs, road signs, vehicle markings, billboards, graffiti — anything readable.  
5. Take **3 different screenshots** containing the target language, each around **1200 × 600**. Every screenshot should include **unique text**.  
6. Optimize all screenshots using **TinyPNG**.  
7. Clone this repository and add your images to the folder **/source/images/**. Name the files using this pattern:  
   - `language1`  
   - `language2`  
   - `language3`  
8. Create a pull request. After a quick review, the new language will be added to the project.
