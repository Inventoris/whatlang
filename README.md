  Guess the language from street signs, store names and random inscriptions 🔣

## What Is This Game?

Guess the language from pictures of street signs, shop names, labels and other real-world inscriptions. Each language has three unique images — once you’ve passed a language, its images won’t repeat (until you make a mistake or the game starts over again).

Right now the game includes 42 languages. All images are manually collected from [Google Street View](https://www.google.nl/intl/eng/streetview/).

You can also choose how many rounds you want to play.

## How It Works

No React, Vue or any other frameworks — just HTML, CSS, JavaScript and images. There are no bundlers, no build tools.

The style is pure web 1.0: maximum simplicity, speed and nostalgia.

## How to Contribute

In the [Issues](https://github.com/Inventoris/whatlang/issues) section, you’ll find a list of languages that are not yet added to the game. Each issue contains instructions on how to contribute a new language.

If you spot a bug or something looks wrong, feel free to open an issue as well — it’s the easiest way to report problems.
